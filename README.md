## Description
Simple bash shell that can execute simple commands and introduces working with pipes, forks, and system calls.

Attempted to change to directories to files including spaces however some issues occurred with that and with the clear program in bash. Used dup2 for pipes as it allows similar functionality with a little less code. Implemented execution of system calls.
